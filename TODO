TODO:
- why is the root folder changed too upon checkout? 
  - It wasn't that way when I ran the commands manually
  - Now when GitStrategy has been extracted we can integration test worktree switching. 


- Move Timetravel calculations away from serializer

- Few worktrees and incremental checking out of next sha for processing. Much faster. 
- Database, where we can prepopulate the state of every file and every commit
  - Populate incrementally from each commit in log. 
  - Only need to care about deltas between commits, and copy everything else from previous commit.
  - processed_commit table with sha and version of processing logic
- Unit tests for simpler new classes
- Integration test for Timetravel
- Refactor Timetravel into smaller parts
- Candlebars on mean dots in graph
