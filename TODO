TODO:

- Change Mode: find the files that were changed for a commit sha and analayse only those files for new complexity levels
- Move Timetravel calculations away from serializer

- Database, where we can prepopulate the state of every file and every commit
  - Populate incrementally from each commit in log. 
  - Only need to care about deltas between commits, and copy everything else from previous commit.
  - processed_commit table with sha and version of processing logic
- Unit tests for simpler new classes
- Integration test for Timetravel
- Candlebars on mean dots in graph
